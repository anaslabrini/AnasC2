## 🧰 Requirements

Before using this tool, please ensure that you have Python 3 and `pip` installed.

### 📥 Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anasslabrini/AnasC2.git
cd AnasC2
```
2. Run the Main Server (Browser C2):
This starts the Flask server that provides both the victim and admin interfaces.


```bash
python3 app.py
```
Victim Page: Accessible at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Admin Panel: Accessible at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin
3. Launch Additional Modules via the Central Launcher:

```bash
python3 boss.py help
```
The boss.py script acts as the controller to manage all other modules.

Display Help Menu:


```bash
python3 boss.py help
```
Run the Browser C2 Attack Module:

```bash
python3 boss.py anasc2
```
HTTP Status Code Checker (status_code.py):


```bash
python3 boss.py code
```
Directory Scanner (massar.py):

```bash
python3 boss.py search
```

Detailed Explanation of Each Component:

    app.py:

       * Initializes the Flask app and Socket.IO server.

       * Defines routes for the victim page (/) and admin panel (/admin).

       * Handles WebSocket messages to perform actions like URL redirection and displaying alerts.

       * Manages client connections and broadcasts messages to connected clients.

    boss.py:

       * Acts as the main CLI launcher for the tool.

       * Uses Python’s argparse module to parse commands.

       * Provides a simple interface to choose which module to run:

           - anasc2 launches the Flask server.

           - code executes the HTTP status code checker.

           - search runs the directory scanner.

       * Contains a help section that outlines available commands.

    common.txt:

       * Contains a list of common directory names and paths.

       * Utilized by the massar.py module to identify potential hidden directories on a target website.

    massar.py:

       * Prompts the user for a target URL.

       * Iterates through paths listed in common.txt, appending each to the base URL.

       * Makes HTTP requests to each constructed URL and reports if the path is found (status code 200) or not.

    status_code.py:

       * Prompts the user to input multiple URLs.

       * Checks each URL for its HTTP status code using the requests library.

       * Provides a detailed status update using rich formatted output for better readability.

    static/hook.js:

       * Runs in the client’s browser.

       * Establishes a connection to the server via Socket.IO.

       * Listens for commands from the admin panel and, based on the command:

           - Redirects the browser to a specified URL.

           - Displays an alert message.

    templates Directory:

       * Contains all HTML templates:

           - index.html serves as the victim page.

           - admin.html is the control panel where commands (like redirect or alert) are issued.

       * Includes associated style files (CSS) and image assets to present a professional UI
